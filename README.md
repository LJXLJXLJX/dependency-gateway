# Dependency Gateway

Dependency Gateway is a read-only dependency cache for build environments. It routes
package managers, prebuild downloads and public GitHub clones to a sticky internal
entry point: it fills the cache in real time while the upstream is reachable, and reuses
already-published objects when the upstream is not reachable.

The project also ships dataset-analysis tooling that discovers the public base images,
package dependencies, direct downloads and GitHub repositories for image prebuilds, and
produces reviewable, executable preparation plans.

Conda preparation jointly resolves declared package specs with a preloaded micromamba
image, probes transitive dependencies, and verifies package checksums and Gateway HITs
during warm-up. Configure `DEPENDENCY_GATEWAY_CONDA_RESOLVER_IMAGE` as described in the
[dataset preparation guide](docs/dataset-preparation.md#conda-preparation).

## Capabilities at a glance

| Scenario | Client entry point | Cache location | Runtime admission |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Configured package-manager source | `/v1/cache/<source>/...` | S3 | source protocol and path policy |
| Conda defaults / conda-forge (`linux-64`, `noarch`) | `/v1/cache/conda-defaults/...`, `/v1/cache/conda-channels/...` | S3, subject to cache mode | Traditional repodata and package-file allowlist |
| prebuild APT | `/v1/cache/apt/v1/...` | S3 | Derived from the repository URI; no source or map required |
| prebuild `curl` / `wget` GET | `/v1/cache/download/v1/...` | S3 | Unseen URLs are fetched on demand from origin; no origin/path registration required |
| Public GitHub clone | `/v1/git/github/<owner>/<repo>[.git]` | Persistent filesystem | GitHub-only protocol constraint; repository plan not checked |
| Public base OCI image | internal Registry reference | Harbor and other Registries | Offline analysis and mirror plan |

S3 is the authoritative storage for HTTP artifacts; the local directory is only used for
on-demand origin staging. Git bare mirrors need random file access, so they are stored
separately on a persistent filesystem such as GPFS. OCI images do not pass through the
Gateway data plane; they are synced directly to the target Registry by
`dependency-gateway-prepare`.

## What happens to a request

```text
build client
  ├─ package / static URL ─> Gateway source policy ─> S3 HIT
  │                                             └─> pinned upstream ─> atomic write to S3
  ├─ GitHub clone ─────────> Git Smart HTTP ───────> bare mirror HIT
  │                                             └─> github.com clone --mirror
  └─ OCI image pull ───────> internal Registry (pre-synced by the prepare tool)
```

Ordinary package sources remain subject to origin, path, query, redirect and protocol
format constraints. prebuild APT and dynamic downloads are separate transparent cache
entry points: they do not audit target URLs against a source plan; APT repositories need no
explicit map, and ordinary queries are part of the request identity. Any semantics-preserving
authentication, custom methods or complex curl/wget invocations should bypass the cache
directly on the client side. The Git path pins the upstream to public
`github.com` and only
serves `git-upload-pack`; it rejects push, credentials, queries, fragments and unsafe paths.

> **The APT and curl/wget dynamic entry points are for the OpenSandbox prebuild automated
> flow only. Do not hand-craft calls, write them into tasks, or expose them to the public
> internet or ordinary Sandboxes. Caller restrictions are enforced by network isolation and
> later prebuild authentication, not by a URL allowlist.**

## Quick start

Requires Python 3.10+. Production runs require S3 by default; the `file` storage is only for
local development and testing.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e .

dependency-gateway \
  --storage file \
  --cache-dir /tmp/dependency-gateway \
  --config config/sources.json \
  --cache-mode all \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8080
```

In another terminal, check the service:

```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8080/healthz
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/status
```

Browse to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/ui/` to inspect cache status, sources, recent failures and the
object inventory.

Common client configuration:

```bash
# PyPI
python -m pip install \
  --index-url http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/cache/pypi-simple \
  requests

# npm
npm install \
  --registry http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/cache/npm-registry \
  lodash

# Dart Pub
PUB_HOSTED_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/cache/dart-pub \
  dart pub global activate melos

# Julia Pkg Server
JULIA_PKG_SERVER=http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/cache/julia-pkg \
  JULIA_PKG_PRECOMPILE_AUTO=0 \
  julia --project=. -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'

# Public GitHub; production must first have the Git mirror route enabled by operations
git config --global \
  url."http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/git/github/".insteadOf \
  "https://github.com/"
```

See the [user guide](docs/user-guide.md) for complete client configuration.

## Production operation

Copy the configuration template and write real credentials into the Git-ignored
`config.local.env`:

```bash
cp config.example.env config.local.env
```

At minimum the following S3 configuration is required:

```text
DEPENDENCY_GATEWAY_S3_ENDPOINT
DEPENDENCY_GATEWAY_S3_REGION
DEPENDENCY_GATEWAY_S3_BUCKET
DEPENDENCY_GATEWAY_S3_PREFIX
DEPENDENCY_GATEWAY_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID
DEPENDENCY_GATEWAY_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

The repository offers two container entry points:

- `scripts/start-gateway.sh --build`: single-machine host-network startup, suited to a dev
  machine or a standalone node.
- `deploy/Dockerfile.hosted`: the Gateway and mihomo are supervised by the same container,
  suited to an internal hosted platform.

See the [operator guide](docs/operator-guide.md) for production deployment, source policy,
cache mode, runtime directories and failure handling.

## Preparing build dependencies for datasets

Analyze first, without writing to the Registry:

```bash
dependency-gateway-prepare analyze \
  /data/harbor-datasets/<dataset> \
  --output-dir /data/artifact-preparation/<dataset>
```

After reviewing the generated plan, sync the missing base images and warm up the problem
packages:

```bash
dependency-gateway-prepare prepare \
  /data/harbor-datasets/<dataset> \
  --output-dir /data/artifact-preparation/<dataset> \
  --gateway-url http://<INTERNAL_GATEWAY>/v1/cache \
  --concurrency 4 \
  --execute
```

Direct-download registration and bulk Git warm-up are separate steps. See the
[dataset preparation guide](docs/dataset-preparation.md) for details.

## HTTP interface

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/healthz` | Liveness check |
| `/ui/` | Read-only web UI |
| `/v1/status` | Sources, per-module and per-source request counters, recent failures and Git mirror status |
| `/v1/objects` | Paginated object inventory |
| `/v1/cache/<source>/<path>` | HTTP artifact GET/HEAD |
| `/v1/git/github/<owner>/<repo>[.git]` | Read-only Git Smart HTTP; compatible with URLs that omit `.git` in submodules |

`/v1/status` and the logs do not return the full upstream URL, proxy address or credentials.
Auto-generated APT and download sources use readable names composed from host/path, with no
hash in the name.
Source configuration additionally records the last-update date and a manual review policy;
these fields do not substitute for the artifact metadata TTL.
Request statistics are first persisted per module (`apt`, `pypi`, `npm`, `go`, `rust`,
`curl` and `git_clone`), then broken out per Gateway source within the module; all GitHub
repositories are aggregated under `git_clone.sources.github`. Pre-upgrade aggregates without
a module dimension are kept in `unclassified`, and aggregates that have a module but no
source dimension are kept at module level under `historical_unattributed`; they are never
disguised as a source and never back-filled by guessing.

## Documentation

- [User guide](docs/user-guide.md): how to point pip, conda, APT, npm, Go, Cargo, Rustup, Git and
  static downloads at the Gateway.
- [Operator guide](docs/operator-guide.md): S3, proxies, source policy, deployment,
  observability and day-to-day maintenance.
- [Dataset preparation guide](docs/dataset-preparation.md): analysis, review, image sync,
  package warm-up, direct downloads and Git warm-up.
- [Developer guide](docs/developer-guide.md): code structure, core invariants, local testing
  and how to extend.

The complete set of CLI arguments always follows the commands themselves:

```bash
dependency-gateway --help
dependency-gateway-prepare --help
dependency-gateway-prepare <command> --help
```

## Current boundaries

- The service itself has no user authentication; deploy it on a trusted internal network or
  behind an existing auth layer.
- HTTP artifacts have no S3 GC, capacity quotas, metrics history backend, or config-write UI.
- Git mirrors do not support private repositories, GitLab, SSH transport, Git LFS or push.
- The Git mirror plan is a warm-up and coverage checklist, not a runtime repository allowlist.
- Dataset analysis is static analysis; dependencies inside runtime concatenation, remote
  scripts, and unresolvable variables may need manual complements.
- `dependency-gateway-prepare` does not modify the original dataset and is not responsible for the
  final task image build.
- Conda channels support traditional colocated repodata/packages; sharded indexes and
  metadata download-URL rewriting are not supported. Installers are separate downloads.

## Development

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Please read the [developer guide](docs/developer-guide.md) before committing changes, and
keep the security invariants of source policy, log redaction, atomic publication and S3 as
authoritative storage.
